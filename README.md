# SPRINT-CBH
Carbohydrate-binding proteins play significant roles in many diseases including cancer. Here, we established a machine-learning-based method (called Sequencebased Prediction of Residue-level INTeraction sites of carbohydrates, SPRINT-CBH) to predict carbohydrate-binding sites in proteins by using Support Vector Machines (SVM). We found that integrating evolution-derived sequence profiles with additional information of sequence and predicted solvent accessible surface area leads to a reasonably accurate, robust, predictive method, with area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.78 and 0.77, and Matthew’s correlation coefficient of 0.34 and 0.29, respectively for ten-fold cross validation and independent test without balancing binding and non-binding residues. The quality of the method is further demonstrated by having statistically significantly more binding residues predicted for carbohydrate-binding proteins than presumptive non-binding proteins in the human proteome, and by the bias of rare alleles toward predicted carbohydrate-binding sites for non-synonymous mutations from the 1000 genome project.
